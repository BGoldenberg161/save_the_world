# Save the World

For our team's save the world hackathon entry we've created a website for users to get involved in the changes needed in their community to address environmental concerns.

# Technologies
Our app is built with React, in the future we'd build an API with state information and partnerships to display relevant info.

# User Stories
A user can visit the website, a user can select their state. A user can see information relevant to that state about specific issues being addressed. A user can direct to nonprofits working on the issue in their state. A user can see volunteer opportunities in their area.
