# Save the World

For our team's save the world hackathon entry we've created a website for users to get involved in the changes needed in their community to address environmental concerns.

# Technologies
Our app is built with React, in the future we'd build an API with state information and partnerships to display relevant info.

# User Stories
A user can visit the website, a user can select their state. A user can see information relevant to that state about specific issues being addressed. A user can direct to nonprofits working on the issue in their state. A user can see volunteer opportunities in their area.

## Our Pitch

The world is changing rapidly due to inaction and the continued advance of climate change. As people suffer from the real effects of our global climate there is a desire to bridge the gap in knowledge and take action. While there is a great desire to become more involved in this issue many nonprofits operate in exclusive networks and can't leverage an outreach program that can scale to technology devices. Our app provides an opportunity to share and advance engagement across users.


Our application helps people learn about issues in their state, find groups to support in their actions, and volunteer on a project to conserve their areas.

### User Stories
A user can view the website and select their state. A user can see the issues in their state, nonprofit partners in their state, and volunteer events in their state. While a user is viewing these issues they are able to involve more of their friends by sharing the website and allowing them to receive the same base level of knowledge and select their own region to get personalized information.


With your support we'll continue to develop our app, creating partnerships within the nonprofit community and building out our api. We'll add the current threats within each state and create a vibrant resource for others.
